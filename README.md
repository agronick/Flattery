#  Flattery

_Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - Oscar Wilde_


Flattery is a laucher for Wear OS that looks like the Apple Watch launcher. Install it and use your watch's settings to bind it to a physical button. 

It is not in the app store yet. See [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/p1l9of/how_to_install_apps_on_wear_os_all_methods/) on how to sideload apps on WearOS. Download the apk from the [releases](https://github.com/agronick/Flattery/releases) page.
